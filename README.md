# arduino-timer-serial-comm
This repository contains an Arduino library for implementing serial communication using timer interrupts. Designed for an Embedded Systems project, the code is encapsulated in a single header file (.hpp). It provides an interrupt-driven approach to manage serial data transmission and reception.
